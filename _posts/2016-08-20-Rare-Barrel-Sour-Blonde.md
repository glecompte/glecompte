I needed to get a gold into the pipeline so I decided to use the recipe I got from Jay from the sour hour.

** Ingredients **

* 14 lb Belgian Pils
* 2 lb 6.4oz White Wheat Malt
* 1 lb 3.2 oz Spelt
* 1 lb 3.2 oz Vienna
* 1 lb 3.2 oz Flaked Oats

** Hops **
0.2 oz US Saaz 8.5% AA @60min


** Microbes **
Yeast cakes from both flemish red buckets
3L starter stepped up from YB Melange vial
	
** Notes **
Mashed at 155 for 60min. Boiled 15.5 gal for 90min. 12.5 gallons remained at end of boil. OG 1.048. Split 11 gallons between 2 buckets, remaining 1 gallon I am using for a YB Lacto Blend starter. Bucket #1 got a portion of yeast cake slurry and melange slurry. Bucket #2 is melange only.

*8/22 Switched bucket #1 to a blowoff tube, yeast everywhere. WLP 530 is crazy stuff.
