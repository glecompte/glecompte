**Notes:**
Used RO water with ez water calc. Mashed at 148. Mash PH 5.3.

Collected 15.5 gallons of 1.060 wort. After the 90min boil about 12 gallons remained. Did a hop stand at 170F.
Could only get output down to 77F, filled 2 buckets with 11 gallons and threw them in my chest freezer at 65F.

Pitched slurry from the 2 yeast starters (2L each but saved around a 3rd of each for later batches.)
o2 bottle ran out during oxygenation of bucket #2, got little to no oxygenation.. airlock activity took a little longer for that bucket.

08/29 Sampled bucket #2, gravity at 1.014, tasted amazing. On the sweet side, not much bitterness present. Moved both buckets indoors to get the temp around 75-80.
