Very first sour, was also the final batch on my old brew system. Innoculated 2L starter with a cup of US pils, left at 100 degrees for a couple days. Saw huge krausen and vigorous fermentation. Suspected yeast contamination so I did not use (should've checked gravity out of curiousity.)

Kept at 100 using home made heat stick for 48 hours. 3.3 ph
Noticed heat was not consistent throughout kettle. Big pellicle.. Kettle was co2 blanked and plastic wrapped, but definitely was a crappy seal. 

Suprisingly had a nice clean acidity with no off flavors despite plastic wrap being the only protection from the elements.
