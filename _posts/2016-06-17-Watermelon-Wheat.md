Just wanted to crank out a quick easy beer to test out the new brew system. Wanted to try and mimic 21st amendment hell or high watermelon.

**Notes:**
Used RO water w/ ez water calc.

Fermented with US-05, added 1 large blended seedless watermelon to each 5 gal portion. Pretty boring beer, but drinkable. Really needs some stronger hops.
