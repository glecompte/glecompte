First attempt at an aged sour. Going for a standard flemish red.

* Boil time: 90min
* Batch size: 11 gal

**Ingredients:**

* 6 lb munich
* 6 lb us pils
* 6 lb vienna
* 2 lb white wheat malt
* 1 lb aromatic
* 1 lb caramunich
* 1 lb special b

**Notes:**
Used RO water with ez water calc. Mashed at 156. Raised temp a little too high after 40min or so.. ended up holding around 159 for another 20min and then raising to 168, total of 75min.

Boiled for 90min. OG 1.056.

Pitched 2 white labs belgian sour mix, 2 white labs flemish ale, 1 white labs pedio and a little brett c along with slurry of a 3L starter of white labs abbey ale.

8/4 Racked from buckets to co2 purged cornies. PH in both buckets was 4.1 and gravity was at 1.015. Tasted good. Left some headspace in #1 and filled #2 to the brim. Put regular corny lids on. Transferred both cakes and ~1/2 gal of remaining beer into a few jars for possible reuse.
