Tried to mimic michael tonnsmiere with his atomic apricot. For the ipa portion I did an all mosaic hopping.. just wanted to try that out.

The night before I got 4 servings of good belly straight shots. 20B cells of lactobacillus plantarum per serving. Pitched all 4 servings into 700ml starter, ending at 1L. Left at 95 degrees.

* Boil time: 30min / 60min
* Batch Size: 11 gal

**Ingredients:**

* rahr 2-row 20lb
* flaked corn 2lb
* carapils 1.5lb
* white wheat 1lb
* acid malt .5lb

**Notes:**

Used RO water with ez water calc. Mashed at 154 for 30min, raised temp w/ herms to about 165 (took about 20min), sparged with 172 degree water. Run off was super clear but was draining too quickly, had to stop sparge, wait for water to fill up and then restart. Stopped sparge at 14.5 gallons, diverted 5.5 gallons through the chiller at ~105 degrees. Noticed gravity was way low.. I need to repair or replace my mill as the free moving mill was getting stuck. I think this and the sparge screw up are to blame for the poor effiency. OG of the sour portion was 1.03. Added lacto starter and moved to garage where it was about 95 degrees. Forgot to lower the ph ahead of time, but I easily could have. I'll keep an eye out for head retention issues.

Restarted the boil on the non sour portion. 

Hop Schedule:

* .8 oz mosiac @60min
* 1.2 oz mosiac @20min
* 1.8 oz mosaic @10min
* 2.2 oz mosaic whirlpool @170 for 20min
* 2 oz mosaic dry hop

This portion came out at 1.049 due to the longer boil. PH 5.2.

Moved to chest freezer and left for 4-5hours at 61f. Pitched a 1.5 liter starter of white labs american blend also started the night before. I then checked the ph of the sour portion and it was already at 3.4!!! I immediately moved to the chest freezer and after chilling for 4 hours I pitched 250ml of brett c. slurry and 1 wyeast french saison smack pack. Curious to see how the acidity turns out. I was worried it might get too tart with such a large lacto starter. 

Plan to add 1oz citra, 1oz chinook to sour portion after apricots.

* 8/7 Added dry hops to ipa
* 8/9 Added 2 cans of apricot puree to sour portion. PH at 3.3
* 8/14 Started cold crash of ipa
* 8/18 Kegged ipa. FG of 1.015 ~4.5%
* 9/5 Cold crashed apricot sour
* 9/7 Kegged sour
